# Railroad Component Detection for Predictive Maintenance using YOLO

This repository contains a notebook focused on automating the detection of railroad components in images using the YOLO. By accurately labeling and detecting critical components, the project aims to support predictive maintenance effortsâ€”allowing for early identification of potential issues before they escalate.

## Technical Overview

The `detection.ipynb` outlines a complete workflow, from data preparation to model training and inference. Here is a high-level technical breakdown:

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Dataset Loading:** `Roboflow` was used to label the images (the original ones can still be found in the `img` directory) which can be downloaded via api directly in the notebook.
- **Preprocessing:** Contrast has been increased to improve model performance, and the images have been resized to 640x640 pixels.

### 2. Model Configuration and Training

- **YOLO:** YOLO v12s was chosen for object detection for its good compromise of training time and overall performance.

### 3. Inference and Visualization

- **Model Inference:** After training, the model is loaded and used to perform object detection on the images in the test and validation sets.
- **Output Generation:** Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes, and the resulting annotated images are saved in the `runs/detect` directory.
